  // Objects and Arrays - Reference vs Copy
  // start with strings, numbers and booleans
  let age = 100;
  let age2 = age;
  console.log(age, age2);
  age = 200;
  console.log(age, age2);

  // Let's say we have an array
  const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
  const team = players;
  console.log(players, team);
  team[3] = 'Lux';
  console.log(players, team);
  // and we want to make a copy of it.

  // You might think we can just do something like this:
  //
  // however what happens when we update that array?
  //
  // now here is the problem!
  //
  // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
  //
  // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
  //
  // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

  const team2 = players.slice();
  const team3 = [].concat(players);
  const team4 = [...players];
  const team5 = Array.from(players);
  //
  // one way
  //
  // or create a new array and concat the old one in
  //
  // or use the new ES6 Spread
  //
  // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
  //
  // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

  // with Objects
  const person = {
    name: 'Wes Bos',
    age: 80
  };

  // and think we make a copy:

  // how do we take a copy instead?
  const  cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 90});
  cap2['name'] = 'Adnan';
  console.log(cap2);


  // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

  // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
  // JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
